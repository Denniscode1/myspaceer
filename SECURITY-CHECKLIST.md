### üö® URGENT - Actions Required Immediately

#### 1. Rotate Gmail App Password

- [ ] Generate a new app password
- [ ] Update your local `.env` file with the new password
- [ ] Test email functionality with new credentials

#### 2. Clean Git History
Choose one method from `clean-git-history.txt`:
- [ ] Option 1: Use git filter-repo (recommended)
- [ ] Option 2: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner  
- [ ] Option 3: Manual git filter-branch
- [ ] Force push cleaned history to GitHub
- [ ] Verify credentials no longer appear in GitHub history

#### 3. Update Environment Configuration
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials:
  ```
  EMAIL_USER=your-actual-email@gmail.com
  EMAIL_PASS=your-new-app-password
  EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-actual-email@gmail.com
  PHONE_NUMBER=your-phone-number
  ```
- [ ] Test all notification functionality

#### 4. Security Verification
- [ ] Scan repository with GitGuardian again
- [ ] Verify no credentials in GitHub commit history
- [ ] Confirm `.env` file is not committed
- [ ] Test that application still works with env variables

#### 5. Document and Prevent
- [ ] Add security note to README
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets (optional)
- [ ] Train team on secure credential management

### üìß Gmail Security Settings
After rotating the app password, also consider:
- [ ] Review recent login activity
- [ ] Enable login alerts if not already active
- [ ] Consider using OAuth2 instead of app passwords (future improvement)

### üîç Files That Were Compromised
- `server/test-email.cjs` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- `server/test-email-quick.js` - ‚úÖ Fixed
- Git history commits - ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs cleaning

### üí° Security Best Practices Going Forward
1. Always use environment variables for credentials
2. Never commit `.env` files
3. Use `.env.example` templates for documentation
4. Regular security scanning with tools like GitGuardian
5. Consider using secret management services for production
