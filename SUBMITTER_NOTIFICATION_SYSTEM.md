3. **Automatic Notifications:** System sends updates to both patient AND submitter
4. **Dual Channel:** SMS for urgent updates, email for detailed information
5. **Complete Journey:** Notifications from queue entry to discharge

## **Real-World Scenarios**

3. EMT receives updates throughout patient's hospital stay
4. EMT learns outcome for professional development

### **Scenario 2: Elderly Patient**
1. Adult child brings confused elderly parent to hospital
2. Child provides their contact info (patient can't)
3. Child receives all updates even when not at hospital
4. Child gets discharge instructions for parent's care

### **Scenario 3: Good Samaritan**
1. Person finds unconscious stranger, calls ambulance
2. Good samaritan provides their contact for updates
3. They receive notifications about patient recovery
4. Community member gets closure and peace of mind

## **Setup Instructions**

```

### **2. Update Your Form**
